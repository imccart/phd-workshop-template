 \medskip
 \textbf{UK Center for Poverty Research} \hfill 8/2016 -- 7/2018 \\
 \textbf{\$50,000} \\
 ``SNAP Benefit Levels, Food Insecurity, and Diet Quality: Evidence from the Food Acquisition and Purchase Survey'' \\
%  \textit{Goal:} Examine how SNAP benefit levels on the intensive margin affect food insecurity, diet quality, and household expenditures. \\
 \textit{Role:} External Consultant \\

 \medskip
 \textbf{AHRQ (R00HS022431)} \hfill 9/2014 -- 8/2018 \\
 \textbf{\$743,360} \\
 ``The Measurement and Evaluation of Competition in Healthcare Delivery Markets'' \\
% \textit{Goal:} 1) develop a new measure of healthcare provider market share that incorporates a hospital's broader physician network (termed PHN concentration), 2) examine the relationship between PHN concentration and quality of care, access to care, and healthcare utilization, and 3) investigate the mechanism by which PHN concentration influences hospital behaviors and ultimately quality of care. The research also examines the relationship between changes in concentration and patient loyalty (or fragmentation of care received), and ultimately how that relationship impacts quality of care, access to care, and healthcare utilization. \\

 \textbf{\$169,445} \\
 ``Analysis and Dissemination of Patient-Centered Outcomes and its Impact on Patient and Physician Shared Decision-Making'' \\
% \textit{Goal:} 1) advance empirical methodologies for the appropriate analysis of patient-reported outcome measures; and 2) assess and define healthcare value across patient groups and the practical implications of information availability on patient and physician decision-making.  \\
 \textit{Role:} PI \\

%\medskip
