# Workshop Templates

Here, we house a few simple templates that you can use to get started on your own materials. 

- In the [CV](/cv/) folder, you'll find some CV TeX files, one from [David Jacho-Chavez](https://www.davidjachochavez.org/) and one from [Ian McCarthy](https://ianmccarthyecon.netlify.app/). You'll also see a "short" version, just to give you an idea of how to arrange your CV if you need to keep it to a single page.

- In the [Cover Letter](/cover-letter/) folder, you'll find an Emory logo file ("Emory.pdf") and a TeX file. If you add your own signature file, then you can use this template for your cover letters and have a nice, professional letter ready to send out for your papers and applications.
